# SatsumaCruiseControl
Satsuma Cruice Control Mod for My Summer Car

This mod was originally created by, <b>RaceDepartment</b> user, [<i>msc.trash</i>](https://www.racedepartment.com/members/msc-trash.384660/)
<b>Discord</b>, <i>NitroPascal#4515<i>. Nitro has stated that he has canceled this project. Yet i implemented use of my api, [Mod API](https://github.com/tommojphillips/ModAPI) to achieve an installable part. There is no logic to the actual cruise control aspect. I have decided to upload this project for an example to use [Mod API](https://github.com/tommojphillips/ModAPI).

<b>Satsuma Cruise Control</b> is a mod for msc. Cruise Control Panel is an installable part for the Satsuma using [Mod API](https://github.com/tommojphillips/ModAPI). No logic for cruise control feature but installs on the <i>Stock Steering Wheel</i> buttons work and sends an event to execute logic code only if the Satsuma has power and is on. 

The Cruise Control Panel can be found near the phone on the right side.
