# SatsumaCruiseControl
<h2>Satsuma Cruice Control Mod for My Summer Car</h2>

This mod was originally created by, <b>RaceDepartment</b> user, [<i>msc.trash</i>](https://www.racedepartment.com/members/msc-trash.384660/)
<b>Discord</b>, <i>NitroPascal#4515<i>. Nitro has stated that he has canceled this project. Yet i implemented use of my api, [Mod API](https://github.com/tommojphillips/ModAPI) to achieve an installable part. There is no logic to the actual cruise control aspect. I have decided to upload this project for an example to use [Mod API](https://github.com/tommojphillips/ModAPI).

<b>Satsuma Cruise Control</b> is a mod for msc. Cruise Control Panel is an installable part for the Satsuma. No logic for cruise control feature but installs on the <i>Stock Steering Wheel</i> buttons work and sends an event to execute logic code only if the Satsuma has power and is on.
